{"text": "\nThis is the latest edition of our special coverage newsletter on the COVID-19 crisis in Palestine featuring dispatches directly from our Palestine correspondent Yumna Patel on the ground in Bethlehem. This newsletter is published Tuesdays and Fridays.\n\n\nIt’s been one month since Bethlehem was shut down due to the coronavirus.\nIt’s an occasion we were hoping to celebrate with good news in the city, but instead, our quarantine orders were extended for another month, and the amount of confirmed cases in the West Bank has more than doubled since last week.\nWe now have 261 confirmed cases of the virus, the majority of which have come from Palestinian laborers working in Israel and their family members.\nEvery day, new stories and rumors emerge in the community about how the virus is being spread: people ignoring their quarantine orders, concealing their illness from authorities, or knowingly interacting with neighbors and family members even though they are sick.\nDespite the urging of Palestinian officials, leaders, activists, and everyday people to stay at home, it seems that there remains, to a degree, a lack of education about the virus as well as cultural stigma.\nOne Palestinian friend told me that some people, particularly in rural areas, are treating the coronavirus with the same stigma that HIV/AIDS carries, and that people are ashamed to have themselves or a member of their families test positive for the virus.\nNevertheless, the government, companies, and grassroots organizations are continuing awareness efforts and advocating for social distancing.\nJawwal, one of the major cellular communications companies in Palestine changed its network name on people’s phones from “Jawwal” to “Stay Home,” and greets users with a similar message before placing any outgoing call.\nThe Arabic version of #stayathome is trending on Palestinian social media, while parody songs in Arabic about “corona” have racked up hundreds of thousands of views on Youtube.\nIn Gaza, photos emerged of people dressed up in coronavirus masks wearing signs targeting children, telling them “stay away from me.”\n\n\n\nAnother video from the besieged territory showed a group of friends holding a small “wedding procession” for their friend ‘Abood’, with traditional Arabic wedding beats blasting away in the background as the group sang “corona, oh corona, oh corona, Aboud will celebrate here tonight.”\nThe procession, while it did not necessarily adhere to social distancing recommendations, gave many people a much-needed laugh, and was a reminder of Palestinian resilience, and people’s ability to roll with the punches of life.\nThroughout all of this, people have continued to support each other in ways that have continued to surprise me.\nItalian rooftop and balcony “quarantine parties” have been mimicked across Bethlehem and Ramallah, while young brides and grooms from Gaza and the West Bank have been forgoing parties and gifts, choosing instead to use their wedding budgets on distributing food parcels to families in need in their communities.\nIn one of the refugee camps in Bethlehem, families of current and former prisoners who receive pensions from the government were reportedly organizing so that they could contribute a portion of their salaries to other people who were struggling.\nThere’s no doubt that the situation is going to become more difficult in the coming weeks, as what little savings people have begins to run dry. With no government protection for workers or unemployment benefits, community solidarity can only take people so far.\nWe’ve seen the occupation continue to run its course over the past month, with daily reports of settler attacks on Palestinians and their property, home demolitions, and Israeli night raids.\nOn Tuesday, Palestinian rights groups reported that in the month of March alone, Israel has arrested 357 Palestinians, including 48 children.\nThere is growing concern among Palestinian activists and ordinary citizens that, while they are being forced to stay at home, Israel is working harder than ever to steal their land, and enforce President Trump’s Deal of the Century.\nOn Monday, those fears were confirmed when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his rival Benny Gantz agreed to move ahead with plans to annex portions of the West Bank as early as this summer.\nThis morning, I was chatting with a local activist who told me something that I’ve been hearing a lot of recently: “We are being told to stay at home, and that will protect us. But as long as we are under lockdown, the occupation will continue to steal our land and arrest our people, and there’s not a thing we can do about it.”\n"}
{"text": "\nAfter over a year of back and forth, and multiple stalemates, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kahol Lavan Chairman Benny Gantz have finally come to an agreement, paving the way for the establishment of a Likud-Kahol Lavan unity government. Their first order of business? Annexing the West Bank.\nIsraeli media reported on Monday that Netanyahu and Gantz agreed on a plan to begin formally annexing parts of the West Bank, as early as this summer.\nAccording to Haaretz, the two rivals agreed that Netanyahu could bring an annexation proposal before the cabinet for a vote as early as July 10, on the condition that the move is supported by the United States, and “done in coordination with other international players.”\nIf the cabinet approves the proposal, it would come before a full Knesset vote, where it is likely to receive a majority of support from Israeli lawmakers who have largely adopted Netanyahu’s annexation policies.\n\nEver since the first round of Israel elections last year, annexation has been a major topic of discussion, with both Netanyahu and Gantz promising voters that if elected, they would annex large swaths of the West Bank, including the Jordan valley which makes up approximately one-third of the occupied territory.\nWhen US President Donald Trump released his peace plan in January, he gave the green light to Israel to move forward with unilaterally annexing more Palestinian land, a move considered to be illegal by the international community.\nIn an urgent letter to Gantz and other Israeli MKs, Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now urged the lawmakers to veto any annexation proposals that come their way, saying it “would have grave consequences for Israel’s future.”\n“As coalition negotiations continue, red lines need to be drawn to prevent the adoption of an extreme right-wing agenda,” the group said, adding that “annexation would not just violate international obligations, but also compromise Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state, and critically endanger existing agreements and regional harmony with Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority.”\nHead of the Arab-majority Joint List, MK Ayman Odeh tweeted his opposition to the move, saying:\n“Gantz’s submission on the subject of annexation is the most serious of all. This means eliminating any chance of peace and the establishment of an apartheid state with Jewish citizens and Palestinian subjects. Democracy, equality and social justice all depend on just peace and the end of the occupation.”\nCoronavirus provides perfect cover\nWith the entire globe focused on fighting the coronavirus pandemic, analysts say Monday’s agreement is part of a strategic effort by Netanyahu to accomplish his right-wing agenda, under the guise of addressing the COVID-19 crisis.\n“The coronavirus pandemic has been the biggest gift to Netanyahu,” Palestinian political analyst Dianna Buttu told Mondoweiss.\n“Israel is treating the crisis as a ‘war’, and during wartime it’s easy for everyone to rally behind the person who is in office, including the very person (i.e. Gantz) who said he would never sit in a government with Netanyahu.”\nWith unrivaled support, Netanyahu is able to advance annexation plans, which Buttu says he is urgently trying to push forward before the US elections go into full swing later this year.\n“If there’s any time to go forward with annexation, it’s now, when everyone is focused on something else,” Buttu said.\nAdditionally, with the entire West Bank under lockdown due to a COVID-19 outbreak that has so far infected 260 Palestinians, Israel will face much less resistance to its plans in the form of protests and grassroots activism.\n“With everyone being ordered to stay in their homes, grassroots resistance is hindered,” Buttu noted. “Israel is using this opportunity to continue its occupation practices such as night raids, arrests, and home demolitions, and all the while activists cannot come together to protest or protect their communities because of the coronavirus.”\nWhile the situation on the ground won’t immediately change if the Knesset approves an annexation bill, once the coronavirus pandemic is over, the reality on the ground in the West Bank will shift dramatically.\nAccording to Buttu, the number one thing that will change as a result of annexation, will be the ease through which settlers will be able to expand their boundaries in the West Bank.\n“Building homes in Ariel settlements will become just as easy as building a new development in Haifa,” she said.\n“Instead of having to navigate through the military apparatus, and get Knesset and military approval before any new construction, settlements will soon be able to get a simple municipal approval in order to build more homes and take more Palestinian land.”\n"}
{"text": "\nIsrael is expected to ramp up its efforts to test for the coronavirus inside its Palestinian communities, after widespread outcry from rights groups condemning the government for ignoring the country’s Arab population amid the global pandemic.\nIsraeli media reported that mobile coronavirus testing clinics would be set up by Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency services in East Jerusalem for the first time since the outbreak started last month, as well as in the largely Bedouin city of Rahat in southern Israel.\nMDA has previously been accused of not going into East Jerusalem neighborhoods to test residents, while Israeli forces have been documented arresting volunteer Palestinian health workers in the city.\nThe Times of Israel reported that two of Israel’s largest Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) would also be setting up testing facilities in the Palestinian cities of Nazareth, Umm al-Fahm and Tamra, as well as in East Jerusalem’s Shuafat and Beit Safafa neighborhoods.\nThe efforts came more than one month after the novel coronavirus began spreading rapidly in Israel, where there are currently more than 7,000 confirmed cases and 37 deaths.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, rights groups and local activists have cried out against what they say has been blatant discrimination against Israel’s Palestinian community, which make up 20 percent of the population, in terms of testing and access to information about the virus.\nOne of the government’s first failures was made by the Israeli Ministry of Health, which for weeks after the outbreak in Israel began, failed to publish its guidelines on how to deal with the virus in Arabic, instead posting only in Hebrew.\nPalestinian members of Israel’s parliament, along with rights groups, filed an urgent letter to Israeli MOH officials demanding they provide immediate Arabic-language updates and access to essential public health information.\n“The Israeli government has been discriminating against Palestinian citizens for years, failing to provide essential information and services in Arabic. There is now an urgent public interest in regular, real-time updates – accessible in all languages – relating to coronavirus,” Aiah Haj Odeh, an attorney with legal rights group Adalah said at the time.\nKnesset Member Sami Abu Shehadeh said: “The handling of this epidemic requires access to information for the entire public – certainly also in Arabic for Arab citizens. Unfortunately, the lack of Arabic-language updates and information on all platforms – and the concurrent investment in dissemination of only Hebrew-language information – highlights the depth of inequality even when it comes to the right to health.”\nFollowing the urgent letter, the Israeli MOH began retroactively supplying Arabic-language information on the coronavirus on its platforms, but the disparity between the government’s response to its Jewish versus Arab citizens continued.\nPalestinian doctors and activists in Israel began reporting a widespread imbalance between the number of cases being reported in Jewish versus Palestinian communities in Israel, and the access to testing in the respective communities.\nA Haaretz report analyzing a MOH map found that the map, which was meant to illustrate places visited by people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, showed no exposure clusters in Palestinian cities, “while displaying hundreds in nearby Jewish communities.”\n“The relatively low number of confirmed COVID-19 in Arab locales also points to possible under testing for the virus,” the report said, adding that:\n“The disparity is particularly obvious in Jerusalem: While the map areas for West Jerusalem and Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem are covered with location pointers showing exposure points, there isn’t even one for the Palestinian neighborhoods, despite having 16 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as well as 330,000 of the city’s residents.”\nReports have also indicated extremely low numbers of confirmed cases among Palestinians in Israel, which health experts have warned is a reflection of the lack of testing, not of the reality of the infection rate in the community.\nThat number is expected to rise significantly in the coming days as more and more Palestinian citizens of Israel get tested.\nAyman Odeh, head of the Arab-majority Joint List has been vocal about the discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel when it comes to getting tested for the virus, speaking out against the practice on Israeli television as well as on his personal social media accounts.\n“It is an unbearable reality in which Arab doctors are at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus, while their families remain in the backyard,” Odeh posted on Twitter on March 28th, saying that “to date, there are no drive-thru testing centers in Arab-majority communities.”\n“There is a grave concern that we are not doing enough testing. It’s a dangerous, unjust and illogical situation,” he said in another tweet.\n“We are all in this fight together, and the infectious nature of the coronavirus commands the authorities to act equitably. If not everyone is treated then no one is taken care of.”\nEarlier this week, Adalah filed another urgent petition to the Israeli High Court, demanding that Israeli authorities provide better access to testing, information, and increased distribution of hygiene products in the dozens of unrecognized Palestinian Bedouin communities in southern Israel.\n“Israel’s failure over decades to provide sufficient health care and other essential basic services to Palestinian Bedouin communities in the Naqab has now devolved into an immediate danger with the rampant spread of the coronavirus,” Adalah Attorney Sawsan Zaher said.\n“Israel must now take immediate emergency measures – before disaster strikes – to detect individuals with coronavirus in the Bedouin villages and to provide preventive and emergency medical services for these communities.”\n"}
{"text": "\nWhen the Palestinian Authority (PA) first announced a state of emergency over the coronavirus in early March, an initial panic swept over the occupied territory, as checkpoints and borders with Israel were closed, and entire cities were shut down.\nIn the early days of the outbreak, which was initially contained to the city of Bethlehem, there was a joke going around between Palestinians that, perhaps, a global pandemic could offer a temporary respite from the terrors of the Israeli occupation.\nBut even as most aspects of everyday life have been turned upside down in Israel, Palestine, and the rest of the world, the one thing that has remained steady in the lives of Palestinians, is the presence of the occupation.\nDespite widespread shutdowns, curfews, and quarantines, Israel has continued to raid Palestinian cities and towns, arrest and imprison Palestinians, demolish homes and tear down structures, and facilitate attacks carried out by settlers.\nPalestinian activists, leaders, and civilians have urged an end to the occupation’s activities in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem, saying that Israel is only further putting Palestinian lives at risk by violating basic global health recommendations of social distancing.\nIn the time of a global pandemic, when most of the world is just trying to stay healthy, Palestinians are stuck between worrying about their health and safety, and the fear of losing their land, homes, and lives to the occupation.\nArrest raids continue despite quarantine orders\nPalestinian news networks and social media have been inundated in recent days with reports of Israeli forces conducting raids in Palestinian cities and towns.\nPhotos and videos show armed and masked Israeli forces raiding homes while wearing protective health gear over their army uniforms.\n\n\n\nSince the outbreak began, Israeli forces have continued to conduct arrest raids in Bethlehem’s refugee camps, Hebron, Ramallah, the Jordan Valley, and East Jerusalem’s al-Issawiya neighborhood and Shuafat refugee camp.\nIn several cases, Israeli forces sparked clashes with Palestinians, using tear gas, rubber bullets, and other measures to suppress the protesters.\nIn a video, reportedly recorded in the city of Hebron, CCTV footage purportedly shows armed Israeli forces spitting on Palestinian cars as they patrolled streets during a night raid.\n\nOMG! 😱😱\nIsraeli occupation soldiers spit on the doors of houses and cars in the occupied Hebron.\nNo comment!!!!!!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/AOw1EOeh6L\n— Sarah Hassan 🌸❤ (@sarah_hassan94) March 27, 2020\n\nSimilar instances of soldiers and settlers spitting on Palestinian property, seemingly in an attempt to spread the virus among the Palestinian population, were reported in Ramallah city and the Beit Iksa village northwest of Jerusalem.\nIn Gaza, Israeli forces reportedly opened fire on Palestinian farmers on the outskirts of the southern Gaza Strip, near the border fence.\nMeanwhile, in East Jerusalem, Israeli forces sparked outrage after they were recorded arresting four Palestinian volunteer health workers as they were disinfecting public facilities outside the Lion’s Gate of the Old City. Israeli forces also seized the sanitation equipment being used by the volunteers.\nSimilarly, in the West Bank town of Hizma, north of Jerusalem, Israeli forces reportedly assaulted teams of volunteer health workers stationed near the entrance of the town and subsequently raided and ransacked the headquarters of the local emergency committee in charge of combating the spread of the virus in the town.\nLocal NGO Grassroots Jerusalem condemned Israel for the arrest of the volunteers in the Old City, as well as its continued implementation of “colonial policies that even the pandemic has failed to stop.”\n“The occupation ‘business’ is continuing as usual even in these times of pandemic,” the group said on Facebook.\n“On the one hand, Palestinians in Jerusalem are fearing the spreading of the virus in their communities, and its grave effects on the economy in Jerusalem, as it depends mainly on tourism. On the other hand, they continue to face the already existing – and continuing – challenges of the Israeli occupation and its policies in the occupied city.”\nSince a state of emergency was declared in Palestine on March 6, the group the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has documented 207 Israeli incursions into Palestinian cities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\nThe group slammed Israel for “completely ignoring the dangers this behavior might cause in light of the spread of the infection in Israel.”\n“These practices pose a public health threat and make it easier to spread COVID19 among Palestinians,” the group continued, adding that it holds Israel, “as an occupying power, fully responsible for these dangerous practices, and demands an immediate cessation of these practices.”\nSettlers exploit lockdown \nJust as the activities of the Israeli army have continued unhindered throughout the occupied territory, Israeli settlers have continued to take over more Palestinian land, damage Palestinian property, and attack Palestinians, unhindered.\nReports of settlers razing lands and establishing new outposts on the outskirts of Bethlehem and Ramallah prompted local officials to accuse settlers of taking advantage of the coronavirus lockdown in order to seize more land.\n“As we are in lockdown in Palestine and the settlers are on the rampage, Israel should take back its settlers and keep them there,” senior PLO official Dr. Hanan Ashrawi tweeted.\nCountless instances of settlers, under the protection of armed soldiers, violently raiding villages in the northern West Bank were reported, as well as instances of settlers attacking farmers near Hebron and Ramallah, chopping down olive and grape trees near Bethlehem, and attacking homes near Nablus.\nIn the Jordan Valley, which has seen a significant increase in settler activity ever since US President Donald Trump gave the green light for Israel’s annexation plans in the area in January, settlers have been attacking farmers and setting up new tents and caravans on Palestinian land.\nThe notoriously violent settlers of Hebron have continued to ignore shelter-in-place orders, attacking Palestinian homes in the Old City, injuring a young Palestinian mand and woman earlier this month.\nSimilar attacks and injuries were recorded in Nablus and Ramallah, in addition to reports of settlers throwing rocks at Palestinian motorists in a village outside Jenin.\nHomes and field clinics demolished\nIsraeli authorities made headlines last week after they raided the Jordan Valley herding community of Khirbet Ibziq and confiscated materials that were being used to set up an emergency field clinic for the area, which is home to dozens of rural communities that lack access to proper healthcare and facilities.\n\nOfficials from Israel’s civil administration, along with a military escort, confiscated poles and sheeting that were going to be used to establish the field clinic, as well as emergency housing for residents in case they were forcibly evacuated from their homes — a regular occurrence due to Israeli military training in the area.\nA tin shack, power generator, sand, cement, and cinder blocks were also confiscated, while a bulldozer demolished the foundation of four of the tent floors.\n“As the whole world battles an unprecedented and paralyzing healthcare crisis, Israel’s military is devoting time and resources to harassing the most vulnerable Palestinian communities in the West Bank, that Israel has attempted to drive out of the area for decades,” Israeli human rights group B’Tselem said in a statement.\nCalling the demolition of the under-construction clinic “shocking,” B’Tselem said the incident was an “especially cruel example of the regular abuse inflicted on these communities,” adding that “it goes against basic human and humanitarian principles during an emergency.”\nB’Tselem continued: “Unlike Israel’s policies, this pandemic does not discriminate based on nationality, ethnicity or religion. It is high time the government and military acknowledged that now, of all times, Israel is responsible for the health and wellbeing of the five million Palestinians who live under its control in the Occupied Territories.”\nOver the past few weeks, Israeli forces have continued its routine practice of home demolitions across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, demolishing homes and agriculture structures in areas around Jericho, Ramallah, Jenin, Salfit, and Hebron.\nAccording to UN documentation, in the first two weeks of March, Israeli forces demolished at least 16 homes and structures, displacing 35 Palestinians in a time when global health officials are urging people to stay at home as the safest way to protect themselves and their communities.\nOccupation biggest health risk to Palestinians\nOn Wednesday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh, who has taken the lead role in Palestine’s fight against COVID-19, said that the “real weakness” in the Palestinian’s efforts to fight the spread of the coronavirus is the Israeli occupation.\nShtayyeh criticized the Israeli occupation’s “policies that attempt to thwart our efforts to protect our people,” referring specifically to Israel’s treatment of Palestinian laborers and prisoners, who are emerging as one of the biggest threats to public health in the West Bank.\nOver the past week, the number of confirmed cases in the West Bank has nearly doubled, with the majority of new cases being traced to Palestinian laborers who returned from Israel.\nAdditionally, one of the newest cases to be confirmed on Wednesday was from a Palestinian detainee who was just released from the Ofer detention center, sparking fears that an outbreak in the prison is imminent.\n“The Palestinian workers’ continued movement, with Israeli facilitation, between their cities, villages, and workplaces, whether inside the green line or in the settlements, is a blow to our early efforts to stop the spread of this pandemic,” Shtayyeh said.\n“Israel’s decision to allow the entry of workers is an attempt to protect the Israeli economy at the expense of the lives of our workers. Israel’s economy is not as precious as the lives of our children.”\n"}
