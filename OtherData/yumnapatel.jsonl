with good news in the city, but instead, our quarantine orders were extended for another month, and the amount of confirmed cases in the West Bank has more than doubled since last week.</p>, '\\n', <p>We now have 261 confirmed cases of the virus, the majority of which have come from Palestinian laborers working in Israel and their family members.</p>, '\\n', <p>Every day, new stories and rumors emerge in the community about how the virus is being spread: people ignoring their quarantine orders, concealing their illness from authorities, or knowingly interacting with neighbors and family members even though they are sick.</p>, '\\n', <p>Despite the urging of Palestinian officials, leaders, activists, and everyday people to stay at home, it seems that there remains, to a degree, a lack of education about the virus as well as cultural stigma.</p>, '\\n', <p>One Palestinian friend told me that some people, particularly in rural areas, are treating the coronavirus with the same stigma that HIV/AIDS carries, and that people are ashamed to have themselves or a member of their families test positive for the virus.</p>, '\\n', <p>Nevertheless, the government, companies, and grassroots organizations are continuing awareness efforts and advocating for social distancing.</p>, '\\n', <p>Jawwal, one of the major cellular communications companies in Palestine changed its network name on people’s phones from “Jawwal” to “Stay Home,” and greets users with a similar message before placing any outgoing call.</p>, '\\n', <p>The Arabic version of #stayathome is trending on Palestinian social media, while parody songs in Arabic about “corona” have racked up hundreds of thousands of views on Youtube.</p>, '\\n', <p>In Gaza, photos emerged of people dressed up in coronavirus masks wearing signs targeting children, telling them “stay away from me.”</p>, '\\n', <div id=\"fb-root\"></div>, '\\n', <p><script async=\"1\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" defer=\"1\"

traditional Arabic wedding beats blasting away in the background as the group sang “corona, oh corona, oh corona, Aboud will celebrate here tonight.”</p>, '\\n', <p>The procession, while it did not necessarily adhere to social distancing recommendations, gave many people a much-needed laugh, and was a reminder of Palestinian resilience, and people’s ability to roll with the punches of life.</p>, '\\n', <p>Throughout all of this, people have continued to support each other in ways that have continued to surprise me.</p>, '\\n', <p>Italian rooftop and balcony “quarantine parties” have been mimicked across Bethlehem and Ramallah, while young brides and grooms from Gaza and the West Bank have been forgoing parties and gifts, choosing instead to use their wedding budgets on distributing food parcels to families in need in their communities.</p>, '\\n', <p>In one of the refugee camps in Bethlehem, families of current and former prisoners who receive pensions from the government were reportedly organizing so that they could contribute a portion of their salaries to other people who were struggling.</p>, '\\n', <p>There’s no doubt that the situation is going to become more difficult in the coming weeks, as what little savings people have begins to run dry. With no government protection for workers or unemployment benefits, community solidarity can only take people so far.</p>, '\\n', <p>We’ve seen the occupation continue to run its course over the past month, with daily reports of settler attacks on Palestinians and their property, home demolitions, and Israeli night raids.</p>, '\\n', <p>On Tuesday, Palestinian rights groups reported that in the month of March alone, Israel has <a href=\"http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=XdMiHea115700805198aXdMiHe\">arrested 357 Palestinians,</a> including 48 children.</p>, '\\n', <p>There is growing concern among Palestinian activists and ordinary citizens that, while they are being forced to stay at home, Israel is working harder than ever to steal their land, and enforce President Trump’s Deal of the Century.</p>, '\\n', <p>On Monday, those fears were confirmed when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his rival Benny Gantz agreed to move ahead with <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2020/04/coronavirus-a-gift-to-netanyahu-activists-slam-gantz-netanyahu-annexation-plans/\">plans to annex portions of the West Bank</a> as early as this summer.</p>, '\\n', <p>This morning, I was chatting with a local activist who told me something that I’ve been hearing a lot of recently: “We are being told to stay at home, and that will protect us. But as long as we are under lockdown, the occupation will continue to steal our land and arrest our people, and there’s not a thing we can do about it.”</p>, '\\n']"}

This means eliminating any chance of peace and the establishment of an apartheid state with Jewish citizens and Palestinian subjects. Democracy, equality and social justice all depend on just peace and the end of the occupation.”</p></blockquote>, '\\n', <h3>Coronavirus provides perfect cover</h3>, '\\n', <p>With the entire globe focused on fighting the coronavirus pandemic, analysts say Monday’s agreement is part of a strategic effort by Netanyahu to accomplish his right-wing agenda, under the guise of addressing the COVID-19 crisis.</p>, '\\n', <p>“The coronavirus pandemic has been the biggest gift to Netanyahu,” Palestinian political analyst Dianna Buttu told <em>Mondoweiss</em>.</p>, '\\n', <p>“Israel is treating the crisis as a ‘war’, and during wartime it’s easy for everyone to rally behind the person who is in office, including the very person (i.e. Gantz) who said he would never sit in a government with Netanyahu.”</p>, '\\n', <p>With unrivaled support, Netanyahu is able to advance annexation plans, which Buttu says he is urgently trying to push forward before the US elections go into full swing later this year.</p>, '\\n', <p>“If there’s any time to go forward with annexation, it’s now, when everyone is focused on something else,” Buttu said.</p>, '\\n', <p>Additionally, with the entire West Bank under lockdown due to a COVID-19 outbreak that has so far infected 260 Palestinians, Israel will face much less resistance to its plans in the form of protests and grassroots activism.</p>, '\\n', <p>“With everyone being ordered to stay in their homes, grassroots resistance is hindered,” Buttu noted. “Israel is using this opportunity to continue its occupation practices such as night raids, arrests, and home demolitions, and all the while activists cannot come together to protest or protect their communities because of the coronavirus.”</p>, '\\n', <p>While the situation on the ground won’t immediately change if the Knesset approves an annexation bill, once the coronavirus pandemic is over, the reality on the ground in the West Bank will shift dramatically.</p>, '\\n', <p>According to Buttu, the number one thing that will change as a result of annexation, will be the ease through which settlers will be able to expand their boundaries in the West Bank.</p>, '\\n', <p>“Building homes in Ariel settlements will become just as easy as building a new development in Haifa,” she said.</p>, '\\n', <p>“Instead of having to navigate through the military apparatus, and get Knesset and military approval before any new construction, settlements will soon be able to get a simple municipal approval in order to build more homes and take more Palestinian land.”</p>, '\\n']"}
{"text": "['\\n', <p>Israel is expected to ramp up its efforts to test for the coronavirus inside its Palestinian communities, after widespread outcry from rights groups condemning the government for ignoring the country’s Arab population amid the global pandemic.</p>, '\\n', <p>Israeli media reported that mobile coronavirus testing clinics would be set up by Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency services in East Jerusalem for the first time since the outbreak started last month, as well as in the largely Bedouin city of Rahat in southern Israel.</p>, '\\n', <p>MDA has previously been accused of not going into East Jerusalem neighborhoods to test residents, while Israeli forces have been documented arresting volunteer Palestinian health workers in the city.</p>, '\\n', <p>The Times of Israel <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/mobile-coronavirus-testing-centers-to-open-in-ashdod-rahat/\">reported</a> that two of Israel’s largest Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) would also be setting up testing facilities in the Palestinian cities of Nazareth, Umm al-Fahm and Tamra, as well as in East Jerusalem’s Shuafat and Beit Safafa neighborhoods.</p>, '\\n', <p>The efforts came more than one month after the novel coronavirus began spreading rapidly in Israel, where there are currently more than 7,000 confirmed cases and 37 deaths.</p>, '\\n', <p>Since the beginning of the outbreak, rights groups and local activists have cried out against what they say has been blatant discrimination against Israel’s Palestinian community, which make up 20 percent of the population, in terms of testing and access to information about the virus.</p>, '\\n', <p>One of the government’s first failures was made by the Israeli Ministry of Health, which for weeks after the outbreak in Israel began, failed to publish its guidelines on how to deal with the virus in Arabic, instead posting only in Hebrew.</p>, '\\n', <p>Palestinian members of Israel’s parliament, along with rights groups, filed an urgent letter to Israeli MOH officials demanding they provide immediate Arabic-language updates and access to essential public health information.</p>, '\\n', <p>“The Israeli government has been discriminating against Palestinian citizens for years, failing to provide essential information and services in Arabic. There is now an urgent public interest in regular, real-time updates – accessible in all languages – relating to coronavirus,” Aiah Haj Odeh, an attorney with legal rights group Adalah said at the time.</p>, '\\n', <p>Knesset Member Sami Abu Shehadeh said: “The handling of this epidemic requires access to information for the entire public – certainly also in Arabic for Arab citizens. Unfortunately, the lack of Arabic-language updates and information on all platforms – and the concurrent investment in dissemination of only Hebrew-language information – highlights the depth of inequality even when it comes to the right to health.”</p>, '\\n', <p>Following the urgent letter, the Israeli MOH began retroactively supplying Arabic-language information on the coronavirus on its platforms, but the disparity between the government’s response to its Jewish versus Arab citizens continued.</p>, '\\n', <p>Palestinian doctors and activists in Israel began reporting a widespread imbalance between the number of cases being reported in Jewish versus Palestinian communities in Israel, and the access to testing in the respective communities.</p>, '\\n', <p>A Haaretz <a href=\"http://haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-s-coronavirus-blind-spot-the-arab-community-1.8720161\">report</a> analyzing a MOH map found that the map, which was meant to illustrate places visited by people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, showed no exposure clusters in Palestinian cities, “while displaying hundreds in nearby Jewish communities.”</p>, '\\n', <p>“The relatively low number of confirmed COVID-19 in Arab locales also points to possible under testing for the virus,” the report said, adding that:</p>, '\\n', <blockquote><p>“The disparity is particularly obvious in Jerusalem: While the map areas for West Jerusalem and Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem are covered with location pointers showing exposure points, there isn’t even one for the Palestinian neighborhoods, despite having 16 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as well as 330,000 of the city’s residents.”</p></blockquote>, '\\n', <p>Reports have also indicated <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-israel-pays-a-price-for-ignoring-the-arab-community-in-its-coronavirus-response-1.8729117\">extremely low numbers of confirmed cases</a> among Palestinians in Israel, which health experts have warned is a reflection of the lack of testing, not of the reality of the infection rate in the community.</p>, '\\n', <p>That number is expected to rise significantly in the coming days as more and more Palestinian citizens of Israel get tested.</p>, '\\n', <p>Ayman Odeh, head of the Arab-majority Joint List has been vocal about the discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel when it comes to getting tested for the virus, speaking out against the practice on Israeli television as well as on his personal social media accounts.</p>, '\\n', <p>“It is an unbearable reality in which Arab doctors are at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus, while their families remain in the backyard,” Odeh posted on Twitter on March 28th, saying that “to date, there are no drive-thru testing centers in Arab-majority communities.”</p>, '\\n', <p>“There is a grave concern that we are not doing enough testing. It’s a dangerous, unjust and illogical situation,” he said in another tweet.</p>, '\\n', <p>“We are all in this fight together, and the infectious nature of the coronavirus commands the authorities to act equitably. If not everyone is treated then no one is taken care of.”</p>, '\\n', <p>Earlier this week, Adalah filed another urgent petition to the Israeli High Court, demanding that Israeli authorities provide better access to testing, information, and increased distribution of hygiene products in the dozens of unrecognized Palestinian Bedouin communities in southern Israel.</p>, '\\n', <p>“Israel’s failure over decades to provide sufficient health care and other essential basic services to Palestinian Bedouin communities in the Naqab has now devolved into an immediate danger with the rampant spread of the coronavirus,” Adalah Attorney Sawsan Zaher said.</p>, '\\n', <p>“Israel must now take immediate emergency measures – before disaster strikes – to detect individuals with coronavirus in the Bedouin villages and to provide preventive and emergency medical services for these communities.”</p>, '\\n']"}

under-construction clinic “shocking,” B’Tselem said the incident was an “especially cruel example of the regular abuse inflicted on these communities,” adding that “it goes against basic human and humanitarian principles during an emergency.”</p>, '\\n', <p>B’Tselem continued: “Unlike Israel’s policies, this pandemic does not discriminate based on nationality, ethnicity or religion. It is high time the government and military acknowledged that now, of all times, Israel is responsible for the health and wellbeing of the five million Palestinians who live under its control in the Occupied Territories.”</p>, '\\n', <p>Over the past few weeks, Israeli forces have continued its routine practice of home demolitions across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, demolishing homes and agriculture structures in areas around Jericho, Ramallah, Jenin, Salfit, and Hebron.</p>, '\\n', <p>According to UN documentation, in the first two weeks of March, Israeli forces demolished at least 16 homes and structures, displacing 35 Palestinians in a time when global health officials are urging people to stay at home as the safest way to protect themselves and their communities.</p>, '\\n', <h3>Occupation biggest health risk to Palestinians</h3>, '\\n', <p>On Wednesday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh, who has taken the lead role in Palestine’s fight against COVID-19, said that the “real weakness” in the Palestinian’s efforts to fight the spread of the coronavirus is the Israeli occupation.</p>, '\\n', <p>Shtayyeh criticized the Israeli occupation’s “policies that attempt to thwart our efforts to protect our people,” referring specifically to Israel’s treatment of Palestinian laborers and prisoners, who are emerging as one of the biggest threats to public health in the West Bank.</p>, '\\n', <p>Over the past week, the number of confirmed cases in the West Bank has nearly doubled, with the majority of new cases being traced to Palestinian laborers who returned from Israel.</p>, '\\n', <p>Additionally, one of the newest cases to be confirmed on Wednesday was from a Palestinian detainee who was just released from the Ofer detention center, sparking fears that an outbreak in the prison is imminent.</p>, '\\n', <p>“The Palestinian workers’ continued movement, with Israeli facilitation, between their cities, villages, and workplaces, whether inside the green line or in the settlements, is a blow to our early efforts to stop the spread of this pandemic,” Shtayyeh said.</p>, '\\n', <p>“Israel’s decision to allow the entry of workers is an attempt to protect the Israeli economy at the expense of the lives of our workers. Israel’s economy is not as precious as the lives of our children.”</p>, '\\n']"}

and it has become ever more apparent that this crisis is going to get much worse before it gets better.</p>, '\\n', <p>There was a hope that the virus could be contained within Bethlehem and other major cities like Ramallah and Nablus, where local authorities are better equipped to deal with an outbreak or enforce a lockdown.</p>, '\\n', <p>But as we see more and more cases being reported in towns and rural villages, that hope has dwindled and has been replaced with a sense of dread — that more people will continue to get sick, and the government will fail to get it under control.</p>, '\\n', <p>As of Tuesday, there were 117 confirmed cases of the virus — 10 in the Gaza Strip, and 107 in the West Bank.</p>, '\\n', <p>The number of West Bank cases nearly doubled over the past week, as hundreds of Palestinian laborers who were working in Israel flooded back into the West Bank.</p>, '\\n', <p>The majority of the new cases have been reported in a cluster of villages in the central West Bank district, west of Jerusalem city, known as the <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/biddu_enclave_infographic.pdf\">“Biddu enclave,”</a> and are believed to have originated from sick laborers who were working inside Israel and Israeli settlements.</p>, '\\n', <p>Despite being in Areas B and C of the West Bank, the cluster of villages are trapped beyond the Israeli separation wall, severely affecting the ability of the PA to contain the virus in the villages.</p>, '\\n', <p>Watching the virus spread in villages like Biddu, Beit Iskaria, and al-Qubeita have served as a harsh reminder that the negative effects of the occupation have not ceased to exist with the coming of the coronavirus; and in the case of the Biddu enclave, the occupation has only served to exacerbate the crisis.</p>, '\\n', <p>People are frustrated, angry, and outraged at the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mirvat.morrar/videos/2874316425987064/UzpfSTEwMDAwODM0MTA5NjM3MDoyNjQ5MzYwMzIyMDE4NjQ1/?id=100008341096370\">videos</a> circulating on social media showing Israeli soldiers dressed in protective health gear raiding Palestinian homes across the West Bank, and <a href=\"https://english.palinfo.com/news/2020/3/27/israeli-soldiers-spit-at-palestinian-houses-amid-coronavirus-outbreak?fbclid=IwAR0KoFkOTCdUGuh-brhYe-4c-uZKOeTyZDavW4t5NI7oVNLx2AGBSNSHWHU\">spitting</a> on Palestinian cars and homes as they patrol the streets during their raids.</p>, '\\n', <p>But in the same breath, the people are all too familiar with the even more frustrating reality that the Palestinian Authority is heavily dependent on the Israeli government when it comes to fighting this virus.</p>, '\\n', <p>Over the past week, health and government officials alerted people to the quickly dwindling number of test kits and swabs in the West Bank, and appealed to the international community to send aid to the occupied territory.</p>, '\\n', <p>At the end of the day, however, it was the PA’s shadowy intelligence agency that secured the arrival of more testing kits on Monday, just days after Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/mossad-brings-another-400000-coronavirus-test-kits-to-israel/\">Mossad brought hundreds of thousands of new testing kits</a> into Israel.</p>, '\\n', <p>Contributing to the rising frustration is the sobering reality that the majority of the population, both in the private and public sectors, are out of work, and whatever little savings they have left are running out.</p>, '\\n', <p>The PA announced austerity measures over the weekend amid expectations that government revenues are going to decline by more than 50 percent but maintained promises that public sector workers like healthcare workers, teachers, and security forces would be paid in full for the month of March.</p>, '\\n', <p>In the meantime, private-sector workers have been promised 50% of their salaries for the months of March and April.</p>, '\\n', <p>While the announcement of salary payments offers much-needed relief for the community, particularly in places like Bethlehem where people have been out of work for a month now, it feels like a bandaid being slapped on a growing wound.</p>, '\\n', <p>A huge sector of the population who relies on work in Israeli settlements and inside Israel, as well as people who are not steadily employed by the government or by the private sectors, are being left in limbo, as the government has no budget to compensate them.</p>, '\\n', <p>But just like the rest of the world, where the government fails, ordinary citizens have stepped in to ease the pain being felt by their community.</p>, '\\n', <p>Organizations in Bethlehem’s refugee camps, where unemployment rates are higher than in the rest of the city, continue to pool their resources to provide essential food assistance to the community in the absence of aid from the government and UNRWA.</p>, '\\n', <p>Many local shops are honoring their longtime customers by allowing people to purchase essential items on an open tab, to be paid back whenever they can.</p>, '\\n', <p>A shoe factory in Hebron has turned itself into the only mask-making factory in all of the West Bank, putting their financial losses aside in an effort to assist the faltering healthcare system.</p>, '\\n', <p>In Gaza, a major clothing factory has stepped up to produce masks and protective gear for the territory’s health workers. The company, which has suffered under decades of Israeli wars and blockades, has even sent its masks into Israel, where the demand for such items has surged.</p>, '\\n', <p>When sharing fears and anxieties with Palestinian friends, the following sentiment always comes  up, in one form or another: “we’ve survived a lot worse than this before.”</p>, '\\n']"}

At least 15 of the new cases, and one death, were traced back to Palestinian labourers who had recently returned from Israel and Israeli settlements.</p>, '\\n', <p>It is estimated that around 40,000 laborers traveled into Israel for work over the past few weeks. While a large number of the laborers are still in Israel, thousands are expected to flood back into the West Bank, raising concerns over how well the PA will be able to deal with the influx of potential virus carriers.</p>, '\\n', <h3><strong>Workers face ‘racist and inhumane’ treatment</strong></h3>, '\\n', <p>Shtayyeh’s decision to call workers back to the West Bank came just one week after the PA, in coordination with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, allowed for Palestinian labourers to travel into Israel so as not to lose their jobs and much needed wages during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>, '\\n', <p>As part of the agreement, the workers would be made to sleep in Israel for at least one or two months. It was a first for Israel, which typically forbids Palestinian labourers from sleeping inside the country due to “security concerns.”</p>, '\\n', <p>The amendment allowing for a long-term stay in Israel was intended to prevent the transmission of the virus between Israel and the West Bank.</p>, '\\n', <p>But just as soon as the workers, who traveled from all across the West Bank, had arrived in Israel, Israel began dumping sick workers at checkpoints along the Green Line.</p>, '\\n', <p>Palestinians were outraged after a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/QudsN/posts/3242131205863758\">video</a> surfaced of a sickly labourer with a high fever, shortness of breath, and body aches lying on the ground after he was dumped by Israeli forces at the Beit Sira checkpoint West of Ramallah.</p>, '\\n', <p>In the wake of the video, several other reports were made of laborers being dropped at checkpoints by Israeli forces. They were reportedly kicked out of their work and denied medical care in Israel after exhibiting symptoms of the coronavirus.</p>, '\\n', <p>“In light of the dangerous, successive developments in Israel and expected measures banning movement, we call on all Palestinian laborers to return to their homes,” Shtayyeh said.</p>, '\\n', <p>Photos and videos showing workers living in squalor conditions were also circulated on social media, as it was revealed that some Israeli employers had not provided proper accommodations for their workers as promised, forcing many to sleep at the construction sites where they worked.</p>, '\\n', <p>PA spokesman Ibrahim Milhem condemned Israeli employers for forcing laborers to live in conditions “not appropriate for humans,” and blasted Israeli authorities for the “racist and inhumane” treatment of sick laborers.</p>, '\\n', <h3><strong>New health risks </strong></h3>, '\\n', <p>The call to bring workers back to the West Bank has sparked a debate within Palestinian society, with many blaming the PA for allowing the workers to go into Israel in the first place, and subsequently endangering the rest of the population by calling them home.</p>, '\\n', <p>Despite the PA’s efforts to contain the spread of the virus, the health risks posed by the laborers are already proving to be an uphill battle for the government.</p>, '\\n', <p>In the village of <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2020/03/palestinians-report-first-coronavirus-death-in-the-west-bank/\">Biddu</a>, at least 15 people were infected with the virus, and one of them died as a result.

Two of the laborers, both residents of the Bethlehem district, tested positive for the virus.</p>, '\\n', <p>The two cases were identified as a man who worked at a gas station in the Gush Etzion settlement, and his mother who worked as a housekeeper in another settlement.</p>, '\\n', <p>Local media reported that man and his mother had come into contact with several people and traveled to the major vegetable market in Bethlehem before being tested for the virus.</p>, '\\n', <p>Despite the government’s efforts –which include ordering all returning workers into a 14-day isolation period, and urging anyone with symptoms to report for testing — it is practically impossible for the government to keep track of the movement of all the workers.</p>, '\\n', <p>A video was published on social media showing laborers from the Hebron area who had just returned from Israel, stranded near a checkpoint and begging to be tested for the virus before they traveled back home.</p>, '\\n', <div id=\"fb-root\"></div>, '\\n', <p><script async=\"1\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" defer=\"1\" src=\"https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v6.0\"></script></p>, '\\n', <div class=\"fb-video\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/100028461910401/videos/331409111151150/\" data-width=\"1020\">\n<blockquote cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/100028461910401/videos/331409111151150/\" class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/100028461910401/videos/331409111151150/\"></a></p>\n<p>حال العمال الفلسطينين في الداخل المحتل 😎</p>\n<p>Posted by ‎<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/people/أنس-نصرالله/100028461910401\">أنس نصرالله</a>‎ on Thursday, March 26, 2020</p></blockquote>\n</div>, '\\n', <p> </p>, '\\n', <p>“We’ve been waiting since 9am for the ministry of health,” one of the workers, who said he just came back from Jerusalem, tells the camera. “We’re waiting for a doctor, for anyone to just come test us.

{"text": "['\\n', <p>For the Palestinians of the northern occupied West Bank, putting your life on the line to defend your land is just a part of life.</p>, '\\n', <p>Countless Palestinians have paid the highest price for attempting to fend off Israeli settlers and soldiers from their cities, towns and villages. On Wednesday, another Palestinian was added to that list.</p>, '\\n', <p>15-year-old Mohammed Abdel Karim Hamayel succumbed to his wounds on Wednesday, hours after he was shot by Israeli forces, along with dozens of other young men from his hometown of Beita, south of Nablus.</p>, '\\n', <p>Hamayel was shot when dozens of armed Israeli troops stormed Jabal al-Arma, or al-Arma Mountain, on the outskirts of Beita, and began violently confronting crowds of Palestinians who were staging a sit-in on the mountain.</p>, '\\n', <p>Soldiers reportedly used live ammunition, rubber-coated steel bullets, and tear gas to suppress the protesters, who have been staging sit-ins on al-Arma for weeks in a collective effort to ward off settlers who have attempted to seize control of the mountain.</p>, '\\n', <p>Official Ministry of Health reports indicated that over 100 Palestinians were injured during the onslaught, including two who were seriously injured with live ammunition.</p>, '\\n', <p>Dozens more were injured and treated for severe tear gas inhalation, including PA Minister Walid Assaf, who is in charge of the popular resistance against the wall and settlements in the West Bank.</p>, '\\n', <h3>Weeks of confrontations</h3>, '\\n', <p>The killing of Hamayel and the violent suppression of the protesters on Wednesday morning was the culmination of weeks of protests on the mountain and confrontations between locals and Israeli soldiers and settlers.</p>, '\\n', <p>Around two weeks ago, settlers from the notoriously violent Itamar settlement published a call on social media to take to the mountain, which they believe is an ancient Jewish religious site, and seize control of it.</p>, '\\n', <p>After becoming aware of the settlers’ plans, dozens of men and youth from Beita took to the mountain and erected a sit-in tent to establish their presence as a deterrence against the settlers.</p>, '\\n', <p>Despite the settler group not receiving permission from the Israeli army to go to the mountain, a smaller group of settler youth decided to go ahead anyway.</p>, '\\n', <p>“There were around 10 settlers, and a group of soldiers who came to protect them and escort them up the mountain,” local activist Minwer Abu al-Abed, 56, told <em>Mondoweiss</em>.</p>, '\\n', <p>According to al-Abed, the soldiers unsuccessfully attempted to escort the settlers up the mountain, shooting live ammunition, rubber bullets, and tear gas along the way.</p>, '\\n', <p>“The settlers were attempting a violent takeover of our land, but of course they [soldiers] were only there to shoot at the Palestinians,” al-Abed said.</p>, '\\n', <p>Videos of the confrontations, which went viral on Palestinian social media, showed crowds of Palestinian youth hurling stones at the settlers and soldiers until the latter were forced to flee the area.</p>, '\\n', <div id=\"fb-root\"></div>, '\\n', <p><script async=\"1\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" defer=\"1\"

being recorded that day, the village celebrated it as a victory.</p>, '\\n', <p>“We made our presence known, and defended our land against the settlers,” al-Abed said, proudly adding that “not a single settlement” has been built on Beita’s land, which he attributed to the steadfastness of the townspeople.</p>, '\\n', <p>The settlers, however would make two more attempts to seize the mountain, each time with more firepower and support from the Israeli army.</p>, '\\n', <p>On March 2, another failed attempt led to the injury of a dozen Palestinians, including two with live ammunition.</p>, '\\n', <p>The third and fatal attempt took place on Wednesday morning — just hours after Israel conducted a <a href=\"http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=427yoVa115356270612a427yoV\">massive arrest campaign in the village</a> —  and though the settlers were unable to seize the mountain, it ended with the death of a young teenager.</p>, '\\n', <h3>‘We will never leave this land’</h3>, '\\n', <p>Clashes between Palestinians and settlers, as the latter attempt to takeover the former’s land, are not uncommon in the West Bank, particularly in Nablus.</p>, '\\n', <p>Settlements like Yitzhar, Itamar, Brakha, have become household names in the surrounding Palestinian villages, who face constant settler attacks on their land, agriculture, livestock, homes, and people.</p>, '\\n', <p>So when the settlers set their sights on al-Arma, the residents of Beita were not surprised.</p>, '\\n', <p>“The fight to defend al-Arma is not a new one,” al-Abed told <em>Mondoweiss</em>, adding that settlers have been attempting to take over the hilltop for decades, ever since the 1980s.</p>, '\\n', <p>“They believe there is a Jewish site on the mountain, and that that gives them a right to it,” he said. “But there are Canaanite ruins here, proving our connection to this land.”</p>, '\\n', <p>According to al-Abed, hundreds of Beita’s residents have been arrested over the years, many in connection with protests at Jabal al-Arma. Two others, he said, were martyred when trying to defend the mountaintop.</p>, '\\n', <p>“Not only does this mountain have historical significance for us, but its important to the daily life of the people of Beita,” al-Abed said, adding that the townspeople not only farm on the hilltop, but also use it for recreational activities, family picnics, and barbecues.</p>, '\\n', <p>“As Palestinians, we will never leave this mountain. The people of Beita will never give up,” he said.</p>, '\\n', <h3>Trump, Netanyahu to blame</h3>, '\\n', <p>While the hilltops surrounding Nablus are dotted with dozens of Israeli settlements and outposts, much of the stolen Palestinian land used to build them is located in Area C — the more than 60% of the West Bank under full Israeli control — making it easier for settlers to take over.</p>, '\\n', <p>Jabal al-Arma, however, was designated as Area B under the Oslo Accords, putting matters like construction and agricultural access to the land under the authority of the PA.</p>, '\\n', <p>For years, the villagers believed that the fact that the mountain was located in Area B would legally protect it from being taken over by the settlers.</p>, '\\n', <p>But when Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett amped up efforts to extend Israeli control over Area B, any sense of security felt by the villagers went out the window.</p>, '\\n', <p>“These recent attempts by the settlers to take over Jabal al-Arma are clearly related to the policies of the right-wing government in Israel,” al-Abed said.</p>, '\\n', <p>And to make matters worse, al-Abed noted, the release of the US peace plan in January only further emboldened the settler movement across the West Bank.</p>, '\\n', <p>“Who do you think gave the settlers and Netanyahu the greenlight to go ahead with annexation, and all of their other plans?” he asked.</p>, '\\n', <p>“Trump did this. When he released the peace plan, he told Israel ‘take whatever you like.’ And now Palestinians are paying the price.”</p>, '\\n']"}

{"text": "['\\n', <p>The village of Turmus Ayya, nestled in a valley between the Nablus and Ramallah districts in the northern occupied West Bank, had high hopes when a local Palestinian company proposed constructing a new housing development on the outskirts of the village.</p>, '\\n', <p>It was a chance for the village, with a population of around 11,000 Palestinians, to expand and address the growing population in their town and draw potential homeowners from the  overcrowding in the nearby city of Ramallah.</p>, '\\n', <p>When the company suddenly stopped construction on the site, the townspeople were left confused. The planned development was located in land designated as ‘Area B’, which unlike Area C, was designated by the Oslo Accords as permisable for Palestinian construction.</p>, '\\n', <p>So, they thought, there couldn’t be any reason for the sudden change.</p>, '\\n', <p>“We learned from the media that Israel was banning construction in Area B, specifically in Turmus Ayya and the villages around the Shilo settlement,” Saeed Hussein, mayor of Turmus Ayya told <em>Mondoweiss</em>.</p>, '\\n', <p>“We were shocked. We know the Israelis ban construction in Area C, but now in Area B too? Soon there will be nowhere left for us to touch!” he said.</p>, '\\n', <h3>‘Security concerns’</h3>, '\\n', <p>The halt on construction in Area B was pushed by Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett, who submitted a letter to the ministry’s legal adviser saying he opposed Palestinian construction in Area B around Shilo due to “security concerns.”</p>, '\\n', <p>According to Israeli media, Bennett’s advisor on settlements, Avi Roeh, wrote in the letter that there was “no real justification for the construction in its current location of all places, and it seems its main purpose is to challenge Israeli security forces.”</p>, '\\n', <p>The<em> Times of Israel</em> <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/bennett-seeks-to-stop-palestinian-construction-in-area-b-south-of-nablus/\">reported</a> that Roeh claimed the developer “declared it to be part of an effort to encourage a Palestinian takeover of lands in the Judea and Samaria,” adding that it was the ministry’s position that the devleopment could have “broad security consequences” for the region and “should not be allowed there.”</p>, '\\n', <p>Bennett’s efforts come after similar efforts by settlers from Shilo, who sent a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urging he put a stop to the construction due to security concerns.</p>, '\\n', <p><em>Haaretz</em> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-bennett-claims-security-difficulties-in-bid-to-block-palestinian-construction-1.8565068\">reported</a> that Bennett’s letter came in response to an appeal by the Palestinian developer who petitioned the High Court of Justice to send Israeli troops to guard the construction site, claiming his workers had come under attack from the settlers.</p>, '\\n', <p>A local landowner Turmus Ayya, who asked to remain unnamed from, has plots of land next to the development, and told <em>Monodoweiss</em> he can vouch for the fact that settlers have been terrorizing the workers ever since they started.</p>, '\\n', <p>“The settlers come and threaten the workers and try to mess up their equipment and destroy the work they’ve done,” he said, pointing to a portion of a newly paved road that had been destroyed, allegedly by settlers from Shilo.</p>, '\\n', <p>Other parts of the road had been haphazardly blocked off with large rocks and debris — an act also allegedly carried out by settlers.</p>, '\\n', <p>“This part of the village is not even close to Shilo, unlike the center part of town, which is just a few hundred meters away from the settlement,” the man said. “So it doesn’t make sense why they’re so opposed to construction here.”</p>, '\\n', <h3>Palestinians already feeling effects</h3>, '\\n', <p>While Bennett’s request still needs to go through a series of approval before its enforced, locals in the villages around Turmus Ayya say they have also been facing pushback from Israeli forces in Area B — something they have never experienced before.</p>, '\\n', <p>In the village of Qaryut, six kilometers north of Turmus Ayya, and three kilometers north of Shilo, activists told <em>Mondoweiss</em> that Israeli settlers and security from Shilo and the nearby Eli settlement have been establishing more of a presence on lands designated as Area B in the village.</p>, '\\n', <p>They say that in the past few months, Israeli forces have stopped work on a house on the outskirts of Qaryut, and confiscated tractors and other equipment belonging to farmers in the area.</p>, '\\n', <p>“They [Israel] have started preventing people from building or working on lands close to the settlements,” local activist Bashar al-Qaryouti, 37, told <em>Mondoweiss</em>.</p>, '\\n', <p>Al-Qaryouti said that people “shouldn’t be fooled” by the claims that the new policies in Area B are being enforced out of “security concerns.”</p>, '\\n', <p>“This is part of their plan to create a bloc of settlements in the Nablus area, and they don’t want any Palestinians standing in their way,” he said, referencing Israeli plans to build a network of bypass roads connecting Eli, Shilo, and a number of other neighboring settlements.</p>, '\\n', <div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_213173\" style=\"width: 2058px\"><img alt='The view from Qaryut of the construction in the \"ancient Shilo\" Biblical

{"text": "['\\n', <p>The Trump administration has dealt another blow to the the flailing Palestinian Authority (PA) in the form of more budget cuts, this time to the PA’s security forces.</p>, '\\n', <p>The State Department released its <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FY-2021-CBJ-Final.pdf\">congressional budget request for 2021 on Monday</a>; noticeably <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/02/trump-budget-hold-palestinian-aid-progress-peace-plan.html\">missing was funding for the Palestinian Security Services,</a> which has received bipartisan support in congress for 27 years.</p>, '\\n', <p>Last year, the US provided the Palestinians with an estimated $35 million for their security services.</p>, '\\n', <p>Since President Trump took office, the US has been steadily cutting humanitarian and economic aid to the Palestinians, plunging the PA and other organizations like UNRWA into deep financial crises.</p>, '\\n', <p>While the new budget does not provide an explicit package for the Palestinian security forces, it does request  $200 million to go towards a “Diplomatic Progress Fund,” that the government could use with “flexibility” to “respond to new opportunities arising from progress in diplomatic and peace efforts around the world…such as progress on a plan for Middle East peace.”</p>, '\\n', <p>Within the Diplomatic Progress Fund is $25 million designated towards security assistance in the West Bank.</p>, '\\n', <p>It is understood that contingent upon the PA receiving such funds would be their acceptance of Trump’s “peace plan” that was released two weeks ago, which they have categorically rejected.</p>, '\\n', <p>The Palestinians have boycotted the US government since it recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017, and have accused the Trump administration of using “political blackmail” to force the Palesitnians to capitulate to their demands.</p>, '\\n', <p>Axios <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-israel-netanyahu-security-aid-palestine-4b22707f-636a-4568-bd80-94da0dcccc77.html\">reported</a> in November that Trump rejected a request from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the US to continue funding the PA security forces, allegedly saying that Israel should foot the bill instead.</p>, '\\n', <p>While the new congressional budget request is subject to major changes given the Democrats’ control of the House of Representatives, nixing funding for the Palestinian security forces came as a surprise to many.</p>, '\\n', <p>The US and Israel have long supported the funding of the Palestinian Security Services in order to maintain “stability” in the occupied West Bank and protect Israel’s security interests.</p>, '\\n', <p>Security coordination between the PA and Israel has been a crucial tool for Israel’s security apparatus for decades. PA President Mahmoud Abbas has <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestinians-incredulous-over-pa-threats-end-security-coordination-israel\">threatened for months to end security coordination with Israel</a> if the latter continues to move forward with annexation plans outlined in Trump’s proposal.</p>, '\\n', <p>Ramallah-based political analyst and former PLO negotiator Diana Buttu told <em>Mondoweiss</em> that she wasn’t at all surprised by the news, saying it was made in line with the the decades-long policy of Israel to slowly dismantle the PA.</p>, '\\n', <p>“Believe it or not, Israel doesn’t need the PA anymore for security coordination,” Buttu said.</p>, '\\n', <p>In the past decade, Israel has worked towards technologically modifying their security apparatus in the occupied West Bank, Buttu said, slowly phasing out the role of the PA as a result.</p>, '\\n', <p>“If you look at the way Israel operates today, a lot of it is being done by their own technological mechanisms,” she said.  “Everything from new IDs with magnetic chips for Palestinians, gates at the entrances to Palestinian areas that be can closed electronically, and facial recognition technology at checkpoints.”</p>, '\\n', <p>“The occupation is very much operating by remote control, they don’t need the PA any longer,” she said.</p>, '\\n', <p>Buttu doesn’t anticipate that the PA will go without funding for its security forces, however, predicting that the EU and other donor countries will step up for the sake of regional stability and due to the fact that the PA security services are the “single largest employer of Palestinians by a long shot.”</p>, '\\n', <p>An unfortunate result of that, she says, will be less funding from donor states for more crucial services like education and healthcare.</p>, '\\n', <p>“More money has been spent by the PA on security than education and healthcare combined,” Buttu told <em>Mondoweiss</em>.</p>, '\\n', <p>“So the next bunch of European money is going to get earmarked towards security, and taken away from the other areas that are much more needed.”</p>, '\\n']"}
