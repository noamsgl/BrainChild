With no government protection for workers or unemployment benefits, community solidarity can only take people so far. \n We’ve seen the occupation continue to run its course over the past month, with daily reports of settler attacks on Palestinians and their property, home demolitions, and Israeli night raids. \n On Tuesday, Palestinian rights groups reported that in the month of March alone, Israel has arrested 357 Palestinians, including 48 children. \n There is growing concern among Palestinian activists and ordinary citizens that, while they are being forced to stay at home, Israel is working harder than ever to steal their land, and enforce President Trump’s Deal of the Century. \n On Monday, those fears were confirmed when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his rival Benny Gantz agreed to move ahead with plans to annex portions of the West Bank as early as this summer. \n This morning, I was chatting with a local activist who told me something that I’ve been hearing a lot of recently: “We are being told to stay at home, and that will protect us. But as long as we are under lockdown, the occupation will continue to steal our land and arrest our people, and there’s not a thing we can do about it.” \n ", "title": "Coronavirus Diary: How do you resist the occupation while under lockdown?", "url": "https://mondoweiss.net/2020/04/how-do-you-resist-the-occupation-while-under-lockdown/", "author": "Yumna Patel", "datetime": "2020-04-07 00:00:00", "folder": "MONDOWEISS", "filename": "MONDOWEISS_Yumna Pa_how-do-y_2020-04-07"}
